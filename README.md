# Graphs SQL/C# Group Project Take 2

Merging what we learned in C# and SQL, our class created [this original Graphs Group Project](https://github.com/RachelRebecca/GraphsClassProject) for a final project.<br/>
We took the data from a database containing graphs, nodes, and edges, and made a visualization using a C# Windows Form.<br/>
We also implemented graph algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Topological Sort, Prim's and Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree), and displayed them using the GUI.<br/>
This is our second attempt to create the project given our professor's corrections.<br/>
In this version, the database also contains flags whether the graph is weighted or undirected as well as the relative location of the node in the Windows Form.<br/>
We also added capabilities to remove nodes, add edges, and remove edges so the user can see how this affects the algorithms.<br/>
We also added an algorithm to check if the current graph is connected or not.<br/>
